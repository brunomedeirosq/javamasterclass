#wrapper classes for primitive data types with additional information like:
Integer.MIN_VALUE
Integer.MAX_VALUE

#to get width for different primitive data types that allow different whole number sizes:
Integer.SIZE
Short.SIZE
Long.SIZE

#important concept of overflow and underflow that the compiler will not evalute as error and will cause miss behavior caused from trying to store a size number in the wrong data type

#default data type for numbers in java is "int" even if we declare "long myNumber = 2147483648;", this will cause error since we need to put a sufix "L" to force java to deal with our number as long like this, "long myNumber = 2147483648L;"

jshell> Integer.MAX_VALUE
$17 ==> 2147483647

jshell> long myValue = 2147483647;
myValue ==> 2147483647

jshell> long myValue = 2147483648;
|  Error:
|  integer number too large
|  long myValue = 2147483648;
|

jshell> long myValue = 2147483648L;
myValue ==> 2147483648

double is the default data type for floating point numbers since it's more precise than float, it's larger and more precise than a float

bit is the smallest unit of data containing at most 2 logical states, normally 0 and 1

8 bits combine to make a single unit of addressable memory, called a “Byte”

however java byte with small "b" is a java primitive data type capable of storing 8 bits at a time

Byte.SIZE = 8 bits (in this case java Byte is a java wrapper class for primitive data type byte that have useful and additioal information such as max and min value, or size/width). Java Byte is a wrapper class used to store the primitive data type “byte” for easier access to built-in advanced functions.

double > 64 bits > 8 Bytes memory to store a number

float > 32 bits > 4 Bytes memory to store a number

1 Byte = 8 bits

Exame question:
To assign a double value (java default data type for floating numbers, decimal or real numbers) to a float variable we need to cast or use the sufix "F"/"f", since if we try to set a double (more precise data type) into a less precise data type like float the compiler will raise an error.

float myFloatNumber = 5.25; > ERROR
float myFloatNumber = 5.25F; > OK
float myFloatNumber = 5.25f; > OK
float myFloatNumber = (float) 5.25; > OK

char occupies 2 bytes of memory, or 16 bits, and thus has a witdh of 16 > the reason it's not just a single byte, is that a char is stored as a 2 byte number, similar to the short. This number gets mapped to a single character by Java.

unicode is an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs.

Unicode examples:

U+0044
jshell> '\u0044'
$43 ==> 'D'

Dec 68
jshell> char test = 68;
test ==> 'D'

Important concept in JAVA: classes in Java are custom data types

String concatenation > A String + anything else, gives us a String as a result, concatenating anything after the String as text to the initial String.

String class is immutable!
StringBuilder classe is mutable!

Importante example when using "variable++;" or "variable+=1;" as example 

jshell> {
   ...>     int result = 10;
   ...>     result -= 5.5;
   ...>     System.out.print(result);
   ...> }
4

the above expression is equal to

jshell> result = (int) (10 - 5.5)
result ==> 4

jshell> 10 - 5.5
$68 ==> 4.5

since the result is int data type when using result -= 5.5; java is doing (int) (10 - 5.5), casting to int, so the result is only the whole number 4, the integer part and the decimal part is discarted.
